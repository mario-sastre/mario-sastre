## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Software Engineer** currently working at **Honeywell**.  

I've had the opportunity to work on two major projects:  
- **VoiceSolutions** (VoiceConsole & VoiceLink)  
- **Rebellion** (previously Rebellion Photonics, before Honeywellâ€™s acquisition)  

My experience spans **backend development, cybersecurity, and DevOps**, where I've contributed to building robust and secure solutions.  

### **My Journey at Honeywell ðŸš€**  
- **2022** â€“ Joined as a **Software Engineer Intern**  
- **2023** â€“ Promoted to **Software Engineer I**

Always eager to learn, innovate, and collaborate on exciting projects!
